# Deployment Commands for Database Fixes

## You need to run these commands to deploy the database fixes:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "/Users/sammackin/Desktop/Claude Code Apps/Health App/food-planning-app"

# Check current status
git status

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Create commit
git commit -m "Fix critical database operations for recipe functionality

## Critical Fixes:
- Enhanced database connection handling with proper error checking
- Implemented atomic transactions with rollback on failures  
- Strengthened authentication token validation
- Added comprehensive error handling for recipes, ratings, and meal plans
- Created health check endpoint for diagnostics
- Enhanced debug panel with real-time system status

## Technical Changes:
- database.py: Added schema verification, improved transactions, enhanced connection handling
- recipes.py: Hardened all endpoints with proper validation and error handling
- RecipeDebugPanel.tsx: Added system health checks and better diagnostics
- MealRecommendations.tsx: Fixed JSX syntax errors for Vercel build

## Issues Resolved:
- Recipe saving failures
- Recipe rating functionality not working
- Adding recipes to meal plans failing
