# TASK_006: AI-Powered Book Recommendations

## Overview
Extend the existing AI recommendation system to provide intelligent book suggestions based on user's reading history, ratings, preferences, and family member profiles. Integrate with the multi-provider AI system already in place.

## Requirements
- Personal recommendations based on user's reading history and ratings
- Similar book suggestions for books user has read and liked
- Genre-based recommendations within preferred genres
- Family-appropriate recommendations considering all family member ages/preferences
- Trending/popular books filtered by user preferences
- Smart filtering by genre, length, reading level
- Exclude books already read or in user's lists
- AI explanations for each recommendation
- Integration with existing multi-provider AI system (Claude, Perplexity, Groq)
- Learning from user's "want to read" vs "actually read" patterns

## Implementation Approach
- Extend existing AI recommendation service to handle books
- Build book-specific recommendation context using reading history
- Create AI prompts incorporating user preferences and family data
- Implement recommendation filtering and exclusion logic
- Build recommendation UI components following existing patterns
- Create different recommendation types (personal, similar, trending, family)
- Add recommendation caching for performance
- Integrate with book search and list management
- Provide explanations for AI recommendations
