# TASK_002: Universal Sharing System

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive sharing system that works across all content types (recipes, books, TV shows, movies), allowing users to share their content with others in read-only mode while enabling recipients to add items to their personal lists.

## Requirements
- Share any content item with other users via username/email
- Shared content appears in read-only mode for recipients
- Recipients can add shared items to their personal "want to read/watch/cook" lists
- Share individual items or entire collections
- Public/private settings for user profiles
- Content-level sharing permissions (public, private, friends-only)
- Ability to revoke sharing access
- Clear visual indicators for shared vs owned content

## Implementation Approach
- Create database models for content sharing relationships
- Build API endpoints for sharing, revoking access, and viewing shared content
- Create sharing UI components that work across all content types
- Implement privacy controls and permissions system
- Build "Shared with Me" sections for each content type
- Add quick actions to add shared content to personal lists
- Create public profile pages showing user's shared content
