# TASK_001: Create Unified Content Models

## Overview
Create database models to support books, TV shows, and movies alongside existing recipes, using a unified content architecture that enables sharing and AI recommendations across all content types.

## Requirements
- Create base content model with common fields (title, description, user association, rating)
- Support content types: RECIPE, BOOK, TV_SHOW, MOVIE
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing recipe system
- Enable unified rating and sharing systems across all content types
- Content-specific metadata stored in JSON fields for flexibility
- User associations via foreign keys for data isolation

## Implementation Approach
- Create new database tables for books, TV shows, movies
- Add content_type enum field to support polymorphic content
- Create Pydantic schemas for new content types
- Implement database migration that preserves existing recipe data
