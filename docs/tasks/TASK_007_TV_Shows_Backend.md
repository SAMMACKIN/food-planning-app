# TASK_007: TV Shows Backend API

## Overview
Build comprehensive backend API for TV shows functionality, including show management, episode tracking, rating system, personal lists (watching, want to watch, completed), and integration with external TV show data APIs.

## Requirements
- Create, read, update, delete TV shows in user's collection
- Search shows by title, genre, network, year using external APIs
- Add shows to personal lists (watching, want to watch, completed, favorites)
- Rate and review entire shows and individual episodes
- Track watching progress across seasons and episodes
- Mark episodes as watched/unwatched with dates
- Season completion tracking and binge watching statistics
- Integration with TMDB and TV Maze APIs for show metadata
- Auto-populate show information, cast, episodes, and images
- Show recommendations based on viewing history
- Next episode suggestions and viewing calendar

## Implementation Approach
- Create TV show-specific database models extending unified content system
- Build RESTful API endpoints for all TV show operations
- Integrate with TMDB (The Movie Database) for comprehensive show data
- Implement TV Maze API as alternative data source
- Create episode tracking system with granular progress monitoring
- Build rating system for both shows and individual episodes
- Add show search functionality with external API integration
- Implement viewing statistics and recommendation engine
