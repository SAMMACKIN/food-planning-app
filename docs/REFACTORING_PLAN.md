# Food Planning App - Major Refactoring Plan

## Overview
Based on comprehensive analysis, the codebase has significant technical debt with a monolithic 2214-line `simple_app.py` file, multiple security vulnerabilities, and redundant configurations. This plan follows a test-first approach to safely refactor the application.

## Phase 1: Security Audit & Critical Fixes (Days 1-2)
**Priority: CRITICAL - Security vulnerabilities must be addressed immediately**

### ðŸš¨ Critical Security Issues Found:

- [x] **Potential SQL Injection**: Raw SQL queries throughout simple_app.py âœ… VERIFIED SAFE
- [x] **Overly Permissive CORS**: Wildcard patterns in production âœ… FIXED

### Immediate Security Fixes:
- [x] Replace hardcoded 'secret' with environment variable âœ… COMPLETED

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### 1. Test-First Approach:

- [ ] Maintain 90%+ test coverage throughout refactoring
- [ ] Run tests after every major change

### 2. Gradual Migration:
- [ ] Keep `simple_app.py` as fallback during refactoring
- [ ] Implement feature flags for new vs old code paths
- [ ] Allow rollback at any point

### 3. Environment Separation:
- [ ] All changes tested in preview environment first
- [ ] Database migrations tested with sample data
- [ ] User acceptance testing before production deployment

### 4. Security Priority:
- [ ] Address critical security issues in Phase 1
- [ ] Security review after each phase
- [ ] Penetration testing before final deployment

## Success Metrics
- [ ] **Security**: 0 critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Code Quality**: <200 lines per file, proper separation of concerns
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: >90% backend, >60% frontend
- [ ] **Performance**: <500ms API response times
- [ ] **Maintainability**: Clear module boundaries, documented APIs
