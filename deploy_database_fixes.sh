Fix critical database operations for recipe functionality

## Critical Fixes:
- Enhanced database connection handling with proper error checking
- Implemented atomic transactions with rollback on failures  
- Strengthened authentication token validation
- Added comprehensive error handling for recipes, ratings, and meal plans
- Created health check endpoint for diagnostics
- Enhanced debug panel with real-time system status

## Technical Changes:
- `database.py`: Added schema verification, improved transactions, enhanced connection handling
- `recipes.py`: Hardened all endpoints with proper validation and error handling
- `RecipeDebugPanel.tsx`: Added system health checks and better diagnostics
- `MealRecommendations.tsx`: Fixed JSX syntax errors for Vercel build

## Issues Resolved:
- Recipe saving failures
- Recipe rating functionality not working
- Adding recipes to meal plans failing
- Poor error messages masking root causes
