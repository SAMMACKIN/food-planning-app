# Navigation Test Plan

## Current Issue
When recommendations are loading and user navigates to other tabs (Pantry, Family, Saved Recipes), those tabs don't load their data.

## Test Steps
1. Go to Recommendations tab
2. Click "Get New Ideas" 
3. While loading (showing "Getting fresh ideas..."), immediately navigate to Pantry tab
4. Check if Pantry data loads

## Expected Behavior
- Recommendations should continue loading in background
- Pantry should immediately fetch and display its data
- No blocking between components

## Actual Behavior (reported by user)
- Pantry tab shows but doesn't load data
- Other tabs also fail to load data while recommendations are loading

## Possible Causes
1. Global loading state blocking all API calls
2. Shared axios instance being blocked
3. Components not mounting properly during navigation
4. AbortController canceling wrong requests
5. React Router issue with component lifecycle

## Solution Ideas
1. Ensure each component has independent loading states
2. Check if components are properly mounting when navigating
3. Verify API calls are being made when components mount
4. Add logging to track component lifecycle and API calls
